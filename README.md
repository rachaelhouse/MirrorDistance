# MirrorDistance
- 3D Slicer Module to Compute the surface-to-surface distance (Hausdorff distance) between an input model and the mirrored, registered version of the input model model 
  - The Model is mirrored by reflecting along the x-axis
  - Model is registered using the ICP algorithm 
  - Distance between each point of the input model and new mirrored model is computed
